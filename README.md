# TypeScriptVader

Welcome to TypeScriptVader! This repository is my personal space to take notes from the course "TypeScript Essentials" on LinkedIn Learning and to showcase my learning journey in TypeScript.

## Overview

TypeScriptVader is a collection of various TypeScript examples and projects that I have worked on as I learn and explore the capabilities of TypeScript. This includes simple demos as well as more complex applications, demonstrating different features and best practices in TypeScript development.

## Repository Structure

- **`src/`**: Contains all the TypeScript and JavaScript files for the projects and examples.
    - **`app.js`**: A simple JavaScript example demonstrating the use of `async` functions with jQuery.
    - **`demo.ts`**: A basic TypeScript file defining a `Contact` class.
- **`tsconfig.json`**: Configuration file for TypeScript, specifying compiler options and includes.
